## General Privacy Tooling Tips 

- Fully open source = peer review, no backdoors. 
- Look for _fully_ open source tools, not just opened encryption implementation etc. 
- European data protection laws tend to be stronger. 
- Watch out for proprietary cores. 
- Before trying a new tool, check that it still exists, is secure (depending on your criteria), and has not been bought/taken over by another body which does not uphold high standards for security and privacy.
